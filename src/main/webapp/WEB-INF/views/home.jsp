<h2>Transforming Dreams into Reality</h2>

<p>Do you dream of making an impact on the world around you? Do you
like the idea of creating solutions today for the problems of tomorrow?
The fields of engineering, computer science, and technology directly
influence progress across the globe at an increasingly rapid pace. For
instance, it took 50 years for the telephone to achieve five million
users and only five years for the Internet to acquire 50 million users.
At the same time, we are faced with great challenges to our environment
and economy. As we move more toward instant communication and business

in a world with fewer barriers, these careers take on a vital role in
helping to shape our future. If you want to be a part of the "big
picture" then engineering, computer science, or technology is for you!</p>

<p>The College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology at
California State University, Los Angeles offers some of the most
exciting and progressive degree programs available today. Since 1997,
the U.S. News and World Report has consistently listed the College among
the top 40 (among non-doctoral granting institutions) in the country. No
wonder that internationally acclaimed organizations are clamoring for
our students and serving on the College's advisory boards.</p>

<p>We provide our students with a creative, collaborative, and
challenging academic environment to ensure their success. Innovation,
excellence, globalization, and integrity are the core premises from
which we educate our students. We believe that the future of
engineering, computer science, and technology is about "Transforming
Dreams into Reality". Be part of LA's future through Cal State L. A.</p>
